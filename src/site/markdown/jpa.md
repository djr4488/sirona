## JPA module

This module aims to monitor JPA invocations.

## Installation

To use this module and get execution time of queries creation (`createNamedQuery`, ...) set
as JPA provider `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.jpa.SironaPersistence`.

If you have in your environment a single "real" JPA provider it should be found automatically but if that's not the
case of if you want to force the implementation set the property `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.jpa.provider`
to the real implementation you want. For instance:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence version="2.0"
             xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence
                       http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd">
  <persistence-unit name="my-unit">
    ...
    <properties>
      <property name="com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.jpa.provider"
                value="org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl"/>
      ...
    </properties>
  </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
]]></pre>

Note: it works for JTA transaction-type units too.
