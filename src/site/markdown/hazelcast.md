#Goal

Be able to monitor an hazelcast cluster.

# Usage

First you need to define a list of cluster:

```
com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.hazelcast.clusters = cluster1, cluster2
```

For each cluster you can define if you want sirona to contact the cluster as a client or a member (client is recommanded):

```
com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.hazelcast.cluster1.client = true
com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.hazelcast.cluster2.client = false
```

Note: next lines explain how to configure a hazelcast client in sirona.properties but since sirona reuses `Xml*Builder` of
hazelcast having a hazelcast config file is enough too.

If a client you can configure it this way:

```
com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.hazelcast.cluster1.addresses = ....
com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.hazelcast.cluster1.credentials = user:password
```

For a member you just need to add a hazelcast.xml in the classloader of sirona hazelcast agent.

Note: in push mode you can configure gauge period through `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.hazelcast.gauge.members.period` property.

# Data

Sirona hazelcast agent will maintain a gauge representing the member number in a list of clusters.
