## JDBC module

This module aims to monitor JDBC invocations.

## Installation

To monitor JDBC just configure your DataSource replacing its `java.sql.Driver` by `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.jdbc.SironaDriver`
and updating its jdbc url from `jdbc:foo:bar` to `jdbc:sirona:foo:bar?delegateDriver=xxxxx`.

Note: delegateDriver needs to be the last parameter (if there are several).
