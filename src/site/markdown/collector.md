# Collector

Collector modules aims to aggregate data from multiple instances.

## Features

Default implementation only store data in memory but you can easily extend it to store data in MongoDB or whatever you want.

Note: this is on our roadmap

## For the impatient

Take a servlet container and deploy `sirona-collector-[version].war`. Collection is done on `/collector` endpoint and
reporting view is accesible through `/sirona` endpoint.

## Configuration

Just use the collector `DataStoreFactory`: `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.store.CollectorDataStoreFactory`.

For instance your `sirona.properties` can look like:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.store.DataStoreFactory = com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.store.CollectorDataStoreFactory
]]></pre>

The `GaugeDataStore` can be configured through `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.collector.gauge.store-class` property.
By default it uses the in memory implementation but you can set your own one if you want.

Note: if your `GaugeDataStore` has a constructor with a `String`, the marker of the store will be passed to the `GaugeDataStore`.

The `CounterDataStore` needs to be an instance of `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.store.counter.CollectorCounterStore`.
By default it is in memory too but it is easily extensible to be persisted if needed.

## Installing the collector

To setup the collector you just need to configure the `DataStoreFactory` (see configuration part) and configure the
servlet `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.collector.server.Collector`.

## Pushing data

The input is an array of event. Events are either gauges or counters.

Here is an array with a single gauge:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
[
    {
        "type": "gauge",
        "time": "-",
        "data": {
            "unit": "u",
            "marker": "client1",
            "value": 0.0,
            "role": "mock"
        }
    }
]
]]></pre>

And here is an array with a single counter:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
[
    {
        "type": "counter",
        "time": "2013-10-21T12:50:40Z",
        "data": {
            "min": 1.4,
            "unit": "ns",
            "hits": 4,
            "max": 2.9,
            "marker": "client1",
            "name": "test",
            "concurrency": 0,
            "m2": 1.4099999999999997,
            "sum": 8.2,
            "mean": 2.05,
            "role": "performances",
            "variance": 0.4699999999999999
        }
    }
]
]]></pre>
