## Plugins

There are several kind of plugins:

* `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.gauges.Gauge` and `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.gauges.GaugeFactory`: you can add your own gauges
* `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.reporting.web.plugin.api.Plugin`: add feature to the web GUI

## Write your own gauge

To add your own Gauge you have two main solutions:

* simply implement a `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.gauges.Gauge` and register it using ServiceLoader mecanism (META-INF/services/com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.gauges.Gauge)
* implement a `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.gauges.GaugeFactory` which is registered it using ServiceLoader mecanism (META-INF/services/com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.gauges.GaugeFactory) and return the gauges you want to register

What is GaugeFactory designed for? Imagine a custom gauge is parameterized. You'll surely want to register it
several times with different parameters. If you use Gauge SPI you'll need to do N implementations (which makes the parameters useless).
With GaugeFactory you just need to return the built instances:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
public class MyGaugeFactory implements GaugeFactory {
    @Override
    public Gauge[] gauges() {
        return new Gauge[] { new MyGauge(1); new MyGauge(2); };
    }
}
]]></pre>

## Extend the reporting GUI

To extend the reporting GUI just write your own `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.reporting.web.plugin.api.Plugin`. Here too it
relies on java ServiceLoader (SPI) mecanism.

Here is the Plugin interface:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
public interface Plugin {
    String name();
    Class<?> endpoints();
    String mapping();
}
]]></pre>


A plugin has basically a name (what will identify it in the webapp and in the GUI - it will be the name of the plugin tab),
a mapping, ie which base subcontext it will use for its own pages (for instance /jmx, /myplugin ...) and a class representing endpoints.

To make it more concrete we'll use a sample (the standard Hello World).

### Define the plugin

So first we define our HelloPlugin:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
public class HelloPlugin implements Plugin {
    public String name() {
        return "Hello";
    }

    public Class<?> endpoints() {
        return HelloEndpoints.class;
    }

    public String mapping() {
        return "/hello";
    }
}
]]></pre>

### Define the endpoints

The `HelloEndpoints` class defines all the urls accessible for the hello plugin. It uses the `com.github.rmannibucau.sirona.reporting.web.plugin.api.Regex`
annotation:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
public class HelloEndpoints {
    @Regex // will match "/hello"
    public Template home() {
        return new Template("hello/home.vm", new MapBuilder<String, Object>().set("name", "world).build());
    }

    @Regex("/world/([0-9]*)/([0-9]*)") // will match "/hello/world/1/2"
    public String jsonWorld(final long start, final long end) {
        return "{ \"name\": \world\", \"start\":\"" + long1 + "\",\"end\":\"" + long2 + "\"}";
    }
}
]]></pre>

The first home method uses a template. The GUI relies on velocity and html templates needs to be in the classloader in templates directory.

So basically the home method will search for templates/hello/home.vm velocity template. It is only the "main" part of the GUI
(the tabs are automatically added). Twitter bootstrap (3.0.0) and JQuery (2.0.3) are available.

Here is a sample:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
<h1>Hello</h1>
<div>
    Welcome to $name
</div>
]]></pre>

If you need resources put them in the classloader too in "resources" folder.

Note: if you want to do links in the template you can use $mapping variable as base context of your link. For instance: &gt;a href="$mapping/foo"&lt;Foo&gt;/a&lt;.

If you want to filter some resources you can add a custom endpoint:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
@Regex("/resources/myresource.css")
public void filterCss(final TemplateHelper helper) {
    helper.renderPlain("/resources/myresource.css");
}
]]></pre>

#### `@Regex`

`@Regex` allows you to get injected path segments, here is what is handled:

* HttpServletRequest
* HttpServletResponse
* TemplateHelper (should be used when you want to render a velocity template which is not in /templates and is not decorated by the default GUI layout)
* String: will inject the matching element of the regex (it is indexed = if you inject 2 strings the first one will be the first group and the second one the second group)
* Long, Integer: same as for String but converted
* String[]: all not yet matched segments of the regex

For instance `@Regex("/operation/([^/]*)/([^/]*)/(.*)")` will match `foo(String, String, String[])`.
If the url is `/operation/a/b/c/d/e` you'll get `foo("a", "b", { "c", "d", "e" })`.
